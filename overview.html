      JWST Proposal 3293 (Created: Tuesday, April 23, 2024 at 4:01:37 PM Eastern Standard Time) — Overview
      We will obtain deep NIRCam imaging of the best Frontier Fields lensing cluster Abell S1063 in seven broadband filters and two medium-band
      filters. The goal is to reach an absolute magnitude limit of \( M_{\mathrm{UV}}=-12 \) for galaxies at \( z>6 \). Using multiple independent lensing models, we simulate
      the lensing power of AS1063 through our NIRCam pointing, with the corresponding uncertainties. Our modeling results in an observed depth of
      \( 30.6\text{–}31~\mathrm{AB\ mag} \).
      The compact morphology and the size of the high-magnification region fits well within one NIRCam module. Therefore, the center coordinates will
      be determined according to the position angle of the allocated observing window. AS 1063 has an excellent visibility window, especially regarding
      the Micrometeoroid Avoidance Zone.
      We will obtain the deepest imaging in F090W (39h) and F115W (39h) to constrain the Lyman break of galaxies during the reionization epoch \( z=6\text{–}9 \).
      We will combine dropout color-color selection techniques and photometric redshifts estimates with SED-fitting tools. To achieve the most
      accurate estimate, we will also obtain longer wavelength imaging in the F150W/F277W pair (23h) and the F200W/F356W pair (19h). This
      combination of filters will be also essential for the selection of Dark Ages galaxies, whose Lyman break is shifted to F115W and F150W filters.
      While the F44W exposure will be simultaneous to F115W, we split the LW channel exposure corresponding to F090W into two exposures for the
      medium-band filters F410M (16h) and F480M (23h). By bracketing rest-frame optical emission lines, these medium-band filters dramatically
      improve the constraints on redshift and physical properties of galaxies. We estimated their exposure times assuming a typical flux of
      \( 2\times10^{-19}\ \mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}} \), which results in \( \mathrm{SNR}=7 \). We use the DEEP8 readout pattern for all exposures. The total science time is 120h,
      and the total charged time is 148h.
      We adopt a compact INTRAMODULEBOX dither pattern with 4 positions to cover the short wavelength intra-module gaps while maximizing the
      full-depth area. In addition, we use a subpixel dither with 4 positions to best sample the PSF. The higher spatial resolution that will be achieved will
      be important for the size measurements of faint galaxies.
